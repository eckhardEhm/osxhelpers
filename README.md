Helpers for handling development on osx

## vagrantDown
Is a set of bash scripts fÃor osx ( Virtualbox only ! ) to find and halt all running vagrant machines.
ThereÂ´s other Options posted on how to "kill" virtualbox instances, but halting them via vagrant makes sure your hosts file gets cleaned up as well.
I am a bash noob so feel free to post feedback on how to enhance this stuff.

### usage
copy to a directory that is avaiable in your executable paths and then run "vagrantDown" from anywhere in terminal.
